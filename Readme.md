# LLM Fine-Tuning and Accuracy Testing on ARC

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related files for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) and testing its accuracy on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset.

The repository needs refinement and is for testing purposes.

## Overview

The notebooks in this repository guide you through the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library and evaluating its performance on the ARC dataset. The ARC dataset consists of a large collection of multiple-choice questions designed to test various forms of reasoning and comprehension.

## Setup Instructions

To run the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Results

After running the notebooks, you should obtain fine-tuned language model weights and accuracy metrics for the ARC dataset. These results can be used to evaluate the performance of the language model and compare it against baseline models or other fine-tuning approaches.
